# Capstone Project: Data Engineering with Snowflake, LangGraph, Fast AI, and Docker

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a data engineering pipeline and natural language querying system using Django, Docker, PostgreSQL and LangGraph.

---

## Step 1: Database Design

- Design the database schema based on the provided Excel sheet structure.

---

## Step 2: ETL Pipeline

- Develop an ETL pipeline to populate a PostgreSQL database using the Django ORM.

---

## Step 3: Data Access Layer

- Create Views and CTEs to Query the Data, Generate Downstream Datasets & Reports.

---

## Step 4: AI Automation

- Add A RAG agent connection to the DB to enable natural language querying.

---

## Step 5: Dockerisation

- Develop a Dockerfile to containerize the ETL pipeline and API endpoint.

---

## Step 6: Microservice Development

- Design a RESTful API using a web framework to handle:
  - File uploads.
  - ETL process triggering.
  - Data querying and access.

---

## Step 7: Deployment

- Deploy the service on a cloud hosting provider.
